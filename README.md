# LinearRegression
The aim of the project was to investigate the influence of measurement errors on the result of linear regression. Prepared examples of adjustments of the linear regression model to the noisy Gaussian noise distribution and uniform noise distribution of the function:
- linear,
- polynomial (square),
- logarithmic transformed exponent.
